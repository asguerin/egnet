            <p class="description">Everlasting Games is a student-run game studio devoted to making high quality and engaging games. Founded in Houston, Texas, we're comprised of a small group of passionate developers, now in Houston and Dallas, who have come together to have fun developing games.

            <h3 class="heading">Base Wars 3</h3>
            <p class="description">Base Wars 3 aims to capture the strategic depth and nuance of typical RTS games such as Starcraft while subverting the high skill floor of such games through a turn-based approach.</p>
            <p class="description">Speedy inputs don't matter as long as you get everything done in your turn, removing the constant reaction-stress and APM of RTS games. However, each turn has a timer on it- you still need to think on your feet and prioritize!</p>
            <p class="description">This game is capable of both local PvP and Direct Connect PvP. Join the Discord and find a match!</p>
